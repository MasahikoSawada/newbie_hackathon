Is there a reason not to have the sourcefile as a column in
pg_settings?

This would default to being available to superusers only, right?  Details
of the file system shouldn't be available to any random user.​

There's an issue freeing these when calling pg_reload_conf():

postgres=# alter system set max_connections = 100;
ALTER SYSTEM
postgres=# select * from pg_reload_conf();
LOG:  received SIGHUP, reloading configuration files
 pg_reload_conf
----------------
 t
(1 row)

postgres=# postgres(25078,0x7fff747b2300) malloc: *** error for object
0x424d380044: pointer being freed was not allocated
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug

Of course a config reload can't change max_connections, but I wouldn't
expect it to crash, either.

+            guc_array->sourceline = -1;

I can't see the need for this since it is reassigned further down.


Personally I think it would be fine to start from 1 and increment for
each setting found, rather than rank within a setting.  If the user
wants per setting ranking that's what SQL is for.  So the output would
look something like:
